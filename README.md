Tweeter sentiment Analysis Project
The aim of this project was to develop a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse and classify the sentiment of tweets from the Twitter platform. Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and trends.
In the age of social media, extracting valuable insights from the massive volume of data generated on platforms like Twitter has become increasingly important. "TweetVibes" is a project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system that can automatically determine the sentiment behind tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative.
The exponential growth of user-generated content on Twitter presents both opportunities and challenges. While tweets can reflect diverse opinions and emotions, manually processing and analysing this content is unfeasible. TweetVibes aims to address this challenge by employing advanced NLP methodologies to automate sentiment analysis and extract meaningful insights from Twitter data.
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter; that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative. Twitter is an online micro-blogging and social-networking platform which allows users to write short status updates of maximum length 140 characters. It is a rapidly expanding service with over 200 million registered, out of which 100 million are active users and half of them log on twitter on a daily basis, generating nearly 250 million tweets per day. Due to this large amount of usage we hope to achieve a reflection of public sentiment by analysing the sentiments expressed in the tweets.
 Analysing the public sentiment is important for many applications such as firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market, predicting political elections and predicting socioeconomic phenomena like stock exchange.
The aim of this project is to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream.
In this project, we utilized a dataset of tweets, pre-processed the text, built and trained a sentiment classification model, and evaluated its performance.
